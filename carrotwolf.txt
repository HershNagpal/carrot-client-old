Wandering trader

glow come from glow rocks or meteors, then they become normal rocks
use glow to light lanterns or for other things

placing lanterns make them stay and carrots and wolves will play around them
they give you vision at night
maybe mage wolf can tp only to lanterns to heal?

Wolf types have a decision tree they will follow with some randomness based on what wolf type they are
A new player will not know how wolves work because of the variation of wolf types, but an experienced player will be able to consistently predict wolf AI

Sticky Wolf: Chases player only
Carrot wolf: Only chases carrots
Stupid wolf: moves randomly and chases nothing and is stupid

item ideas:
judgment skewer - instakill in front and behind
better omen - burst heal
faded memories - respawns the same wolves on the board at the edge
unholy might - take a lot of your HP to kill wolves
incarnated gold magecarrot - teleports wolves randomly, slight heal and xp
last rites - if you're low, big heal or something

axe weapon type - one tile in front and the one to the side based on handedness. bonus damage to trees
(jack)hammer weapon type - only thing that can break rocks when they exist
spear - extra tile forward. pitchfork?
throwing weapons? 


wolf type ideas:
easily distracted wolf
pouncing wolf - stands still for a turn and then moves double or triple
mage wolf - teleports between lights at night or shoots projectiles? teleports when its low and heals?
bull wolf - faster if in the same row or column
dash wolf - teleports onto you if youre within 2 tiles
poison wolf - some kind of debuff
glutton wolf - eats carrots and gets stronger
healthy wolf - runs when low to heal off of carrots


Version 1 checklist:
Weapon types: spear, axe
Wolf types: at least 1 or 2 more
